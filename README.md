## Project Overview

This project is a **Python-based Linear Regression model** developed as part of Task 1 of my SkillCraft Technology internship.  
It predicts the selling price of a house based on features such as **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms**.  
The project demonstrates regression modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and performance evaluation.

## Features

- Predicts house prices from given features  
- Performs **EDA** using scatter plots & correlation heatmaps  
- Implements **Scikit-learn LinearRegression**  
- Evaluates with **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- Makes predictions for new input data  

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding regression algorithms for continuous value prediction  
- Performing EDA to identify feature relationships  
- Training/testing ML models with Scikit-learn  
- Using evaluation metrics (R², MSE)  
- Making predictions on new, unseen data
